A number N is called a factorial number if it is the factorial of a positive integer. For example, the first few factorial numbers are 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, â€¦
Given a number N, the task is to print all factorial numbers smaller than or equal to N.

Example 1:

Input: N = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The first factorial number is 
1 which is less than equal to N. The second 
number is 2 which is less than equal to N,
but the third factorial number is 6 which 
is greater than N. So we print only 1 and 2.
Example 2:

Input: N = 6
Output: 1 2 6
Explanation: The first three factorial 
numbers are less than equal to N but 
the fourth factorial number 24 is 
greater than N. So we print only first 
three factorial numbers.


PROGRAM:

long long fact(long long N)
{
    if(N<=1)
        return 1;
    return N*fact(N-1);
}
class Solution
{
public:
    vector<long long> factorialNumbers(long long N)
    {
        vector<long long> vec;
        long long f;
        for(int i=1;i<=N;i++)
        {
            f=fact(i);
            if(f<=N)
                vec.push_back(f);
            else
                break;
        }
        return vec;
        
    }
};
